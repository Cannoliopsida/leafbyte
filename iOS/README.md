# LeafByte on iOS

Xcode is the recommended development environment.
Open iOS/LeafByte.xcworkspace in Xcode to begin work.

You should be able to immediately run the app in a simulator.
If you want to run the app on a real device, after connecting your device and choosing it from the device dropdown, open the top-level LeafByte item.
Under the General tab, choose a valid "Team" (such as your Apple account), associate your device with your account if asked, and accept any messages on your device or computer to allow the connection.

LeafByte uses CocoaPods to manage dependencies (specifically for Google Sign-In), but you shouldn't have to worry about that unless you're adding a new dependency.
