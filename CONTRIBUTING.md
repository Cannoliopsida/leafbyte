We welcome contributions! Thank you for being part of our community!

There are READMEs for iOS and Android to try to help you set up your dev environment.
If your contribution is going to take you much time at all, we encourage you to reach out to leafbyte@zoegp.science first.
That way we can make sure to streamline your work by being sure we're aligned on the contribution (and make sure we aren't duplicating work).
We're also happy to help you get a dev environment working or figure anything out in the code.
Even if you're not able to do the coding work, emailing us about bugs to fix or useful features to add is very helpful!
